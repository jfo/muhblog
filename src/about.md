This is the about page
======================

There is nothing here, and nothing links to it. How did you find it anyway?

I was a musician, now I'm a programmer. I lived in New York, now I live in
Copenhagen. I have a lot of opinions, but I'm never quite sure of them; I am
open to persuasion. I have a son, and a cat. I write here because it's an open
channel to virtually the whole world that I control completely. There's
something quite special in that, don't you think?
